# Minecraft Server Admin Flutter App

A Flutter application for managing Minecraft servers with Firebase integration.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Firebase

First, you need to configure Firebase for your Flutter app. Run this command in the app directory:

```bash
cd app
flutterfire configure --project=minecraft-server-automation
```

This will:
- Open your browser to log in to Firebase
- Configure the Firebase project for your Flutter app
- Generate the necessary configuration files for Android, iOS, and Web

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd app
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Start Firebase Emulators (Optional)

To use Firebase emulators for local development:

```bash
cd app
./start_emulators.sh
```

The emulators will be available at:
- Auth: http://localhost:9099
- Firestore: http://localhost:8080
- Storage: http://localhost:9199
- UI: http://localhost:4000

### 4. Run the App

```bash
cd app
flutter run
```
